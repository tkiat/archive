# My skills include computer, coding, web, and Linux.

## In addition, I also have a solid grasp of fundamental Math and Physics in primary-school, high-school and university levels. I would love to teach the concepts rather than memorization.

## I would rate my English skill as *Full Professional proficiency*. I communicate with non-Thais at ease while working abroad. I have limited German knowledge also.

## I am learning software fundamentals, how to code and design, and how to live more sustainably.
