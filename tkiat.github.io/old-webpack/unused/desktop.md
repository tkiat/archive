# Projects
- [**Lazyman Pomodoro**](https://github.com/tkiat/lazyman-pomodoro). Based on Python and ncurses. I built this because I couldn't find a simple CLI pomodoro clock that supports pause, simple statistic, and configurable session lengths.
- [**Terminal Game Client**](https://github.com/tkiat/terminal-game-client). Based on Python and ncurses. I built this because popular game clients didn't show playtime in a detailed format (hh:mm:ss). It's a simple CLI game client that supports any supplemental commands such as wine64.

# Misc.
- [tkiat Guix Channel](https://gitlab.com/tkiat/guix-channel). I fork suckless repositories and create a Guix channel for them.
- [My personal Dotfiles and Configs](https://github.com/tkiat/dotfiles-and-configs).
