Menus
1. Linux
2. Windows
Contain Linux/Windows game library. You must add one or more parent directories inside "settings.conf" file. The parent directory contains game folder(s). In each game folder, you need to make a symlink or shortcut to the main executable start file. By default, the name of this symlink or shortcut is start.sh (Linux native game), start.wine32 (Linux with wine 32 bits), start.wine64, or start.lnk (Windows). If you don't like it, you may change it under "settings.conf".

3. ErrLog
It is initially blank but it will display some errors (stderr, if any) after running some games.

4. Records
Time spent summary is shown here. Additionally, two main types of records are offered, you can open and edit them as you wish from here. 
	4.1 Record by game (format {"game title": "hh:mm:ss"}).
	4.2 Record by date (format { "year": {"week number": "hh:mm:ss"}}). I use week number since it is the most consistent (5 working days and 2 holidays) unlike month where some months may contain more holidays than others.

5. Setting
Here you may change game directories, default editor, data locaitons, window border, theme, and menu order. A change requires restart.

6. Help
Open this file.

7. Exit

Note from Author
Either mouse or keyboard is supported. Simple double click or trigger enter key on the game you wish to open. The terminal game client is designed to be adjustable in size, the game library may shrink into more pages with smaller window size. The application crashes; however, if you set it at a very small size. Feel free to report bugs if any.
