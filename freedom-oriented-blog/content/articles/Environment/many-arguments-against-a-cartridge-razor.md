A cartridge razor here refers to a multi-blade razor, the most popular of all razors in the market. "popular" does not always guarantee "good", and that unfortunately applies to the current state of a multi-blade razor. I have ditched all of them for a $1 double-edged razor and a $3 shavette and never looked back ever since.

### Arguments Against a Cartridge Razor
- **It is Usually Proprietary**. A cartridge razor is usually not made compatible with many other handles, especially from other vendors. This makes it worse for the environment because a user might throw the incompatible handle to the trash bin. The situation is totally different for double-edged razors where every brand has the same standard and size. A double-edged razor's user not only has more freedom to choose and change the razor when he is not satisfied with it, he also finds it very easy to give it to others because of full compatibility.
- **The Packaging is Often Unethical**. I have seen many multi-blade makers produce a plastic box containing less number of razors than the available slots. This is clearly done with personal gains in mind, less for the environment.
- **Its Current Design is Bad for Environment**. If you think about it, it uses slightly less amount of metal than a double-edged razor. However, the blades in the market currently come with non-removal plastic.
- **Some Come with Non-Replaceable Blades**. Obviously, this really harms the environment.
- **It is Very Expensive in a Long Run**. A cheap Gillette razor blade costs around 20 THB while a cheap double-edged blade costs 1.2 THB. A double-edged handle can be expensive (> 1000 THB) but I use a 40 THB one exclusively for about a year, and it still works great. being very cheap, I have to dry it every time to prevent rust.
- **The Quality is Subpar and Inconsistent**. While the first-time experience can be blissful, most multi-blade shavers often shave as many times as possible until the blade is in the terrible state. The worse experience at the end of a blade lifecycle offsets the initial good feeling. A double-edged razor; however, is very cheap that you can replace it at least every week for a truly consistent shave.
