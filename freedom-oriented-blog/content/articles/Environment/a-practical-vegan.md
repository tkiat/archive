Many people in India are vegetarians by religion. It is sometimes reasonable to follow such religious practice at least because that is the way to fit in and respect the culture. However, some other not-by-religion vegan people, take it religiously that they don't eat animals at all no matter what. I sincerely appreciate these people because they really don't harm animals but their practice is still far from being reasonable. It is the fact that all dead animals are dead and there is no way to revive them anymore. The **only** way we can help is to reduce the sentient animal product supply down the road, not by not eating meat.

I would like to call a vegan with reasonableness "a practical vegan". Their goal is to end further animal exploitation, this is equivalent to zero supply of sentient animal products. And as such, they don't set the abstinence of animal products as a goal because it is not the same as the aforementioned goal.

### A Practical vs (Self-Imposed) Religious Vegan
- Imagine you are alone in the cabin and the meat is going to rot soon and you cannot prevent it. Do you still eat that meat if you are considered a vegan? Some vegans might not eat since that happens to conflict with his unnecessary rule book. Practical vegan; however, uses reason and realizes that eating that piece of animal doesn't at all affect the meat industry. He, therefore, might or might not eat as he wishes. In my opinion, eating meat in that situation is the way to show empathy to the animal because he makes its life more worthy.
- Imagine you are alone again in the cabin and you have only one leather jacket made by tiger skins and his friends. It is always cold inside. Should you go out and buy a synthesis product? Some vegans might say yes. On the other hand, a practical vegan will certainly say "not necessarily" because it does not reduce the supply of sentient animal products.
- Now change the situation. This time you are a celebrity and you are going out to meet fans in the open public outside. Of course, the live show will be on television. Should you reuse that leather? If he is a practical vegan he would likely go and buy synthetic leather and keep leather a jacket at home. Why? Because he realizes that even if he tosses one leather jacket, the benefit of not advertising it on TV is immense. After all, he only wants to reduce the animal product supply.
