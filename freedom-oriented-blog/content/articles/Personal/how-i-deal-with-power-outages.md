I didn't experience a power shortage when I was in Germany but it is a common problem in Thailand. When the lightning strikes hard, often the power is gone for a few seconds or even longer. This article aims to cover how to choose your stuff to cope with the occasional shortage. I will add more items over time.

### Items
- **Internet**. A router without battery can cause unreliable browsing experience so you should make sure it has one. If the 3G/4G signals in your area are strong, the internet bundled with a SIM card can be a better option. I am using 80GB/month SIM card in Thailand and paying on the average for just 4 dollars per month! I put the SIM card into a 10$ feature phone and use it as a hotspot device. Now my internet is reasonably fast. I haven't used MIFI before but from my experience, a hotspot signal from a 10$ phone does the job well.
- **Power Bank**. I am using a phone as a hotspot and a power bank complements it extremely well. My Anker PowerCore 15600 power bank can serve my hotspot phone for like 2 days of the internet without external electricity.
- **Razor**. Having a non-electric razor as a primary or a backup shaving tool can give you a consistent look no matters what is going on.
- **Extra Batteries**. While it can be somewhat hopeless to change a smartphone battery (I spent more than 1 hour for HTC One M7), you can change a dumb phone in a matter of seconds.
