DuckDuckGo is a privacy-oriented search engine started many years ago. Unlike Google whose business is built around surveillance capitalism, DuckDuckGo relies on non-targeted ads that match the search keyword and affiliations. It is therefore a search engine of choice for many privacy advocates.

### Reasons
- **Main Reason: !Bang**. !Bang is its killer feature. Basically, it allows the user to take the search term to other websites. Enter !g obama will transfer the search term 'obama' to Google, while !s will redirect you to Startpage. Plenty of websites are supported such as Youtube, Vimeo, StartPage, Reddit, and many more! Go to this [link](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) to find list of supported bangs available. This feature makes DuckDuckGo my personal one-stop service.
- **Work on Tor Browser**. People should have the rights to use an anonymous browser and, unlike Google, DuckDuckGo supports it.
- **Don't Track Me**. Since I use Linux, I am more and more privacy aware person. I have a creepy feeling each time when someone keeps watching me all the time, the same goes for a search engine.
- **Personalized Ads and Contents Make Me More Stupid**. Think about it. They narrow my experience so I will become a less well-rounded person.
- **Google might be able to Get Me Better Results but I can Simply !s**. Startpage is a privacy-focused search engine gets search results from Google. It puts some ads on top of each page, making it a little less convenient option than Google. I do think the ads are not too distracting at all. It collects strictly anonymous statistics though (from its privacy policy), but I am fine with it.
