While a feature-rich smartphone brings us immense benefits, it can sometimes distract us and reduce our personal freedom. I notice many people always staring on his/her smartphones on a BTS Skytrain. Of course, we are not lifeless stones, and sitting on the train every day can be boring. However, this causes a shorter attention span among young generations. Also, I don't quite get why someone would shell out 1000$ or more for an easy-to-get-stolen smartphone, it's just too risky and usually less repairable. My HTC one m7 was rated 1/10 from iFixit for repairability. And its battery was swollen!

### Feature Phone Experiment

So I made an experiment to ditch a smartphone and use a feature phone only. A feature phone is similar to a very dumb phone in the past armed with some enhanced functionalities like taking a photo, calculator and listening to a radio. There will be less distraction at work since I cannot easily use social media. Their absence at work also makes me look even more professional! When I come back home I can use social media on my tablets or laptops instead. So I don't miss out on anything while becoming a much more organized person. It also reduces unnecessary spendings for another expensive phone which will have the same apps as installed on my tablets.

My feature phone of choice is True Super Hero 4G Entertainment (black) and True Super Hero 4G Entertainment Plus (red). The latter is a newer version but almost identical in functionalities. Owning these is an eye-opening experience for me for many reasons.

* Both cost only 10 dollars each. Each even comes with an adapter, a USB cable, and an earphone! The quality of an earphone is abysmal but hey it works!
* They are very repairable, a 5-year-old can easily remove the battery away and replace it.
* They have back cameras, the plus model also has a front camera as well. The quality is horrendous, but nevertheless, it just works. Just don't expect to backup any legal document with it.
* Both are capable of a 4G hotspot. I am using 80GB/month prepaid sim card that costs 1400 baht per year (around 45 USD) on a phone as a hotspot for my iPad and laptop. The quality is good enough that I can play mobile games absolutely without lagging (most of the time). I connect this phone to a charger all the time.
* I am using one of these phones with a cheap prepaid SIM card as the main communication device.
* The SIM card is tied to the True corporation (one of the top 3 largest service providers in Thailand). This limits my freedom quite a bit but the device is very cheap anyway. On the plus side, I am not worried much about signal issues since it has a good infrastructure.

### The Return of Smartphone

Of course, it goes without saying that a smartphone is still useful. A killer app for me is Google Maps. I recall when I was in Germany and I wanted to cycle to another nearby city, I didn't know the route and a traditional map will certainly become waste after using it. I found Google Maps on a smartphone useful since I couldn't take a laptop or even an iPad with me when cycling, it's just not very convenient. I also missed the smartphone camera. A compact camera can capture moving or low-light objects much better than a modern phone but lacks versatility. Some apps are meant to work outdoor, for example, coronavirus tracker and government financial support for spendings at street food.

I got all the benefits of a feature phone and I wanted to get (not replace) even more with a smartphone. My HTC one m7 battery repair kit just came to my house (about 10 dollars including the battery). Remember I said it has 1/10 score from iFixit? It took me more than one hour for a task that is supposed to be around half a minute maximum. Here is my setup.

### My Feature Phone + Smartphone Setup

- One feature phone as a main communication device.
- One feature phone with an internet SIM card as a hotspot at home with constant charging.
- One smartphone as a special device on a specific occasion. I only use it when I deliberately plan in advance to take photos outside or really need some apps.

This way, I get all benefits from a smartphone while I am not constantly distracted by using it.
