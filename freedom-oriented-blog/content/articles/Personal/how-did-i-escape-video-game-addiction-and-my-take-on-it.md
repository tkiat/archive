I have spent at least 5500 hours in my life for video games. It was a fun journey with a splash of addiction. I found that many games are not created equally, some made me more addicted and resentful, a few are excellent that I praised them over and over again. This article explored my experience as a gamer and how I escape the addiction rabbit hole.

### My Top-4 Ranking in Hours (Self-Estimate)
- Online
    1. **2200**: Clash Royale
    2. **2000**: Dota 1
    3. **400**: Hearthstone
    4. **150**: Gwent
- Offline
    1. **400**: Battle Realms
    2. **150**: Red Alert & Yuri's Revenge
    3. **40**: Hollow Knight
    4. **35**: Planescape: Torment

The first two longest are both online games. Dota is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game in which you, together with fours teammates, fight the opposite team of 5. It's a PC game, so I didn't have much chance to play it unlike a free-to-play mobile game like Clash Royale. On top of that, Clash Royale has around 5 minutes of match length, so I kept playing and playing. Clash Royale makes me aware about the danger of a free-to-play game: a game maker wants to keep a game alive, so they make games as addictive as possible by exploiting the rewarding-circuit in human brains. Couple with the fact that online games often have no endings, people can waste hours into it.

It is clear that I spent significantly less time on offline games. Not only they usually have endings, they usually exploit less human's psychology. Why? They get one-time payment for their games and therefore they don't benefit much from keeping a player in a game. Among offline games, Battle Realms is an outlier because I got only that games installed when I was 13 and basically that was the only choice I had. I did have a lot of fun though.

### The Pointless Accumulation
I was not known as a digital pirate since I was young. I only bought a genuine game in a box and was very proud of my ethics. After the beginning of the steam era, I had never tried to accumulate games until I firstly got a monthly subscription from Humble Bundle. That wore out real quick like 3 or 4 bundles because I realized that I didn't have time to finish any of them.

What hit me hard was GOG. GOG, like steam, is an online digital game store focused only DRM-free games (except Gwent and some small DRM features in some games). What I thought was that I could buy it once and stored it on my HDD forever. It motivated me to keep buying discounted games. Currently, I got around 200 paid games in the library.

Another addiction is getting freebies from Epic Games store. I only finished Celeste so far (and bought 9.99 soundtracks from Bandcamp thereafter) and I knew that I would never have time to finish every free game they offered. But it was hard to refuse such very good offers, so I wasted time claiming free games every week.

### How Did I Stop the Addiction? One Word: Open Source
It was an open-source mindset that liberated me from all these pointless stuff. I firmly believe now that everything installed on the client side must be at least open-source because I wonder if any spyware exists in their products. While it true that every game I have installed required no root access (on Linux), I still don't trust any of their code. In addition, I would rather spend time improving the open-source ecosystem rather than playing too much video games.

And you know what? Almost every game on the market is not open source. As a result, I gave away my free Epic Games account to another. I tried to sell Clash Royale and Blizzard games as well. It is against their ToS, but I, being a firm believer in the rights to sell, neglected their ToS. I decided to keep GOG account because it is a very customer-oriented company with excellent ToS (in my opinion) but I deleted all of their games from my HDD. I don't play them anymore.

I still play games though but, this time, only open-source games. Many games are available on a Linux package manager like SuperTux, SuperTuxKart, and The Battle for Wesnoth. I can also get more games tagged 'open source' on itch.io. None of these games is psychology manipulative so Yay! I escaped the addiction.

### My Take on Video games
I always like to compare video games with novels. A novel can give you more fantasy since it has no implementation issues (just ink on paper), while video games have much more limitations: budgets, technology, workers, etc. However, video games usually offer more control to gamers, for example, freedom to add certain attributes to a character and freedom to choose story. A game like Planscape: Torment has around 800000 words of script, making it comparable to a long novel like Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I view video game as a glorified novel with more features: sound, movie, visual interaction, and so forth. In this point of view, it is not at all reasonable for a novel junkie to reject all games as pointless.

Not every game is addictive and manipulative. Some games, like Playdead's INSIDE, can be finished in a matter of a few hours with an excellent story and atmosphere. You don't need to reject all games, just choose them wisely.
