One of the first things I did after coming back to Thailand from a long journey in Germany in Feb 2018 is learning algorithms. I have learned basics during both my bachelor's and master's degrees but as my interest shifted to programming, I wanted to know more. I enrolled in Stanford's algorithms specialization because of its fame and course rating. I got hooked after finishing it so, I decided to enroll in another similar specialization from UCSD. I believe I am among a very few persons to finish both specializations (only an unemployed madman does) so I decide to do a prospective learner a favor by writing this article. It took me 1 month for each specialization, or equivalent to 49 dollars spent for each.

### Introduction to Standford's Algorithms Specialization
The specialization focuses deeply on theory. So deep that I sometimes skipped the lecture and just to the assignments! I would recommend this course for an aspiring computer scientist. By the way, I am not impressed with the assignment format. You can just put a correct number to pass the assignment. Unlike the UCSD assignments, they always have hidden test cases. I mostly forget the material so I just list 4 courses here.

- Course 1: Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
- Course 2: Graph Search, Shortest Paths and Data
- Course 3: Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
- Course 4: Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems, and What To Do About Them

### Introduction to UCSD's Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization
The specialization offers a lot of coding assignments. There are a variety of languages to choose from in assignments, for example, cpp, Python, Javascript, and some other functional programming languages. The runtime limit for each submission depends on the programming languages used, with cpp being less forgiving than Python. So I wrote everything in cpp ðŸ˜Ž. The only submission I submitted only in Python is the third (or fourth not so sure) question in the capstone project where my cpp didn't pass the time limit :(. This is the hardest MOOC course by far (from my experience) so I believe newcomers are very likely to take longer than a month. One question in the capstone project took me a day! Prepare for that.

Content-wise, the specialization (6 courses) is about basic data structure and algorithms from basic to more advanced. The genome-related courses provide me the insight into the concrete way the algorithm knowledge can contribute to real-life applications. The capstone project is about analyzing the genome sequence. It is hard for me but like every other course in this specialization, there is a healthy amount of hint from the discussion forum. Code copy/paste activity is strongly discouraged of course, but pseudocodes are available. I would recommend this course to anyone.

- Course 1: Algorithmic Toolbox. They introduce you to the stress-test method, which is the way to determine the robustness of the solution. After that, they show algorithms basics such as Fibonacci, GCD, and Big-O Notation. Next, they dive into greedy algorithms topics like a functional knapsack. Then, they focus on divide-and-conquer algorithms like a linear search and a binary search. Sorting problems are also covered here. The last section of the course is all about dynamic programming that breaks down problems into subproblems. The result of each subproblem can be utilized to find the solution.
- Course 2: Data Structure. The first part is about the basics of data structure like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees. Then they go forward to dynamic arrays and amortized analysis. The rest of the topics are priority queues, disjoint sets, hash tables, and binary search trees.
- Course 3: Algorithms on Graphs. The basics of graphs are covered here. The shortest-path algorithms (by the number of nodes or by weights) are discussed thereafter. In the end, they talk about the minimum spanning tree: the shortest subsets of edges that connect all nodes together.
- Course 4: Algorithms on Strings. Algorithms on strings are important e.g. in the DNA sequence analysis. The basics such as suffix trees and suffix arrays are covered here. The popular pattern matching algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) is also covered which is proved to be more efficient than the naive brute force algorithm.
- Course 5: Advanced Algorithms and Complexity. List of topics: flows in networks, linear programming, NP-complete problems. Most topics here are presented with pseudocodes so even though they are advanced topics the student can finish them. I find the flows in networks assignment hard even if the hint is there.
- Course 6: Genome Assembly Programming Challenge. It's the final project with 6 assignments. Not all are required to pass. I admit that I didn't complete all of them but that is because I wanted to complete it within one month (so that only 49 dollars were spent lol). The questions were very challenging to me, definitely not for the faint of heart.

### Summary
Standford's course is more theoretical heavy while UCSD's course is more practical (and more workload).
