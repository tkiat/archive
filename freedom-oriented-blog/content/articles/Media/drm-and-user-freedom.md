DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It is a technology that puts some restrictions on the usage of digital content. A DRMed book bought from Amazon prevents a user from reading a book without Amazon's client. A DRMed game bought from Ubisoft must be started using its client. These DRM adders intend to prevent illegal distributed copies. Many countries make it illegal to remove some forms of DRM even if it's for personal use. By contrast, DRM-free media looks the same as the ones you would pirate from shady sites. You can put it into any device you like, given the format is supported. Often the DRM-free media is offered in many formats so you don't usually need to worry about it.

The distributor/publishers all have the right to add DRM to their products, made with their blood, sweat, and tear! However, not every DRMed ridden media lives up to their promise as they can usually be cracked. Some exceptions include online games having the server that send other important information like assets and game logic in addition to the base game. Even then, it is not justifiable to the user as described below.

### How DRM Undermine User Freedom
- It punishes paying customers. All DRM protections on some forms of media: music, movies, and books can be always circumvented. You can always make a record of them using tools such as a recorder, a camera, or a text processor. As a result, a pirater can enjoy that media without any restrictions, unlike the paying customers.
- User has fewer choices in how to deal with the media. Some have to download only Apple's apps to watch an iTunes movie, while they can open DRM-free movies using VLC or other media players they like.
- Some media that work only with the connection to the server are destined to be disappeared in the future when the company ignores that server. Many users think they own the products but it turns out to be just a rental and they can't do anything about it.

### How DRM Enhance User Freedom
It might sound counter-intuitive but I find one case where DRM enhances user freedom. Let me elaborate.

Firstly, I would like to talk about the benefit of a subscription-based model? Traditionally people had to buy VHS and cassettes and that cost a lot of money, so many of them illegally pirated the media. On the other hand, Netflix, Xbox Game Pass, Kindle Unlimited, and the like allow those poor souls to consume a lot within a month.

Secondly, I would say DRM helps make subscription services viable. What's gonna happen if Disney+ offers all of its movies DRM free? I can imagine most people will download everything during the first month and then unsubscribe thereafter. It's also likely that they share the movie with their family members or friends. Almost no one is going to buy blu-ray discs anymore since for roughly the same price they get a lot more from Disney+. As a result, Disney+ will probably end up not profitable. DRM helps prevent this from happening.

Thirdly, let's consider the hierarchy of needs in the context of digital media. The lowest (most basic) need is to have any access at all. It's the subscription-based service that lowers the entry threshold, just think about shared Netflix locally. The user freedom definitely lies somewhere above the lowest in that hierarchy, making it less important.

This doesn't mean it is justifiable to have only a subscription service as a choice as the whole population can be subjected to global surveillance. However, what if a media not only offers to the user a typical DRM-free option with a reasonable price but also include it inside the subscription service with DRM. In the perspective of that media only, such subscription service doesn't undermine user freedom, it actually enhances user freedom by offering a user more option in addition to the available DRM-free option. Since any subscription service requires DRM to sustain itself, DRM can sometimes enhance user freedom.
