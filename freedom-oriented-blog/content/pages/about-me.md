### My Life Purpose and How Did I Found It?
Purpose matters. A person without any purpose is like someone floating in the middle of the ocean without any sight of the land. In such a scenario, it is illogical for that person to resist any wave at all since it doesn't matter. He floats right and left, left and right until he drowns. I don't want to live like him so purpose matters to me.

I have contemplated the worthwhile purpose despite the meaninglessness of the universe and the absurdity of life, and finally found the way. The single universal purpose doesn't exist but we, as sentient beings, have limitations and weaknesses. My only hope is to find and then utilize those limitations, this way, I can find my purpose. As I introspect my personality, I am very inclined to be independent. This limitation enhances my empathy to a being born without freedom. I am using this limitation as the purpose. While technologies already give us a great deal of convenience in life, I can still sense much limitation of our freedom. A lot of issues nowsadays from each banana wrapped in plastic, a drink water vending machine without the "last filter changed date" display, a closed-source software and firmware, and many more should be addressed. These issues are much bigger than my own capability but together we can improve things. I would like to become a devotee of freedom, starting from open source contribution.
