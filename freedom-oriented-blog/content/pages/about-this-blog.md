All articles in this blog are freedom-friendly. I have a rather simplistic view of the definition of freedom based on three essential prerequisites:

1. Full power to do anything you wish.
2. Don't let others compromise your freedom
3. Respect others' freedom.

Absolute freedom is almost always not attainable, but living with ethics is certainly possible. Ethical living is not about the result, for there are factors beyond one's control. It is about always making the best decision that aligns with one's value. Most of us live with a false sense freedom, some live in the authoritarian regime, some live in a dirty place, and some eat KFC every day and never finish a dish. Below are categories in my personal blog with some elaboration. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks.

1. **Environment**. Living vegan is an essential way to respect the animals' freedom, while living zero waste makes the environment more sustainable which is crucial for our freedom.
- **FOSS**. It stands for free and open-source. Open-source is the software whose code can be inspected. The "free" part is the ability of the user to modify and distribute codes.
- **Media**. I put only media available in a DRM-free format here. A physical book is not included here because it is an enemy of a nomadic lifestyle. A video game and software must also be open-source.
- **Personal**. This blog covers the topics regarding personal freedom including addiction, privacy, and security.
- **Web**. Web enables freedom of expressions.
