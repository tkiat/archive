					<span>Hi! I am </span>
					<span class='about__header'>Theerawat Kiatdarakun</span>
					<span> from Thailand. I have some </span>
					<span class="about__subheader">Experience Abroad</span>
					<span>including M.Sc. of Communications Engineering from Germany, 6-month engineering internship in Dresden Germany, and a year working in a non-engineering job in Berlin. While his</span>
					<span class="about__subheader">Experience in Thailand</span>
					<span>including B.Eng in Engineering from SIIT and worked as a teaching assistant for a while but that was very long ago like in 2011 or so. Let's talk about what I am doing recently. Nothing has actually pigued my interest since I came back from Germany, things don't actually make sense to me. People already have good stuffs, good infrastructure. As a result, I just play video games and have no desire to work though I was intereted in programming so first I finished two algorithm specializations from Coursera but found no immediate practical benefits. I finished most of freeCodeCamp curriculums (5 out of 6) but still found nothing to do. I shift my interest to Linux when I actually learn how to use it day by day. It teaches me the power of freedom since I have the power to change anything. It gives me comfort everytime I use my old 2008 Vaio laptop equipped with Void Linux.</span>
					<span class='about__subheader'>My Mission Statement</span>
					<span>is therefore to provide freedom to others. I am living a less-waste lifestyle and currently digging into open-source ecosystem. I feel a good sense of harmony now. This website is a repertoire of my blogs and projects to remind myself what I have done.</span>
					<span class='about__subheader'>My Current Goal</span>
					<span>is to find jobs, any job that I can sustain myself financially. I do </span>
					<span class='about__subheader'>Coding as a Hobby</span>
					<span> and also want to do it prefessionally. I am familiar (but not yet expert) with </span>
					<span class='about__subheader'>Languages</span>
					<span> such as HTML/CSS/SCSS/JS, Go, Python, Bash/Zsh, VimScript. </span>
					<span class='about__subheader'>DevOps</span>
