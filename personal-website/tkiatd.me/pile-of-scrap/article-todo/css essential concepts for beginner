I have come across the quesdtions like how to set widhtr and height of a link but i think its better to understand basic concepts first than asking questions over and over again.

note that there might be more solutions than written here

inline and block element
- inline element height and width are ignored to solve this assign display: inline-block.


font
- scaling based on container width https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056591/font-scaling-based-on-width-of-container
