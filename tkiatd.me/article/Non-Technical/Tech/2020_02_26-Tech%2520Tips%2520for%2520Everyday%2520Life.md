Use passphase or even better, password manager

A human is usually terrible at making passwords. Phases such as "password", "password123", "\<firstname\>\<lastname\>" are not secure. I recommend using a passphase: a combination of words such as "correct horse battery staple". The amount of entropy (randomness) is very high, making it almost impossible to guess. Even the phase "Tr0ub4dor&3" is not as secure as the previous mentioned passphase.

**So why password manager is better?**

Imagine you use the same password on every websites, including banking websites. The security of well-known brands like Google and Microsoft are top-notch but what about another random shady website you are logging using the same password? If the password is leaked on that website, a cracker (or bad hacker) can use the same credential to login to your bank account.

The best way to cope with this is to set different passwords for all websites. But our average Joe memory does not allow us to do so. That's where password manager comes in. It stores all passwords for us and is usually integrated to common web browsers like Chrome and Firefox, mobile OS like android and iOS, and desktop OS. Here are some examples of password manager:

- Lastpass
- Bitwarden
- Keepass
- 1Password

We need to remember only one password to use a password manager though. Again I recommend using a passphase. 

**Can we really trust a password manager?**

That is your work to research yourself about each password manager. Or you may simply use an open-source password manager since everyone can verify the code. Password manager like Bitwarden even allows you to host it yourself on your own server! All passwords are non-reversible hashed, which means if a cracker somehow manages to get your hashed password he can still not get your true password.

Use Private Browsing
</summary>

Also known as Incognito mode. It offers users more privacy than standard browsing. In this mode, no browser data and browsing history is stored on your computer. You can go to private browsing mode by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + P in Firefox or CTRL + SHIFT + N in Chromium-based browsers.

**So why is it useful?**

* Since almost every website does not allow you to log on many accounts at the same time, you can just open incognito mode and login another account. 
* There are some websites that limit number of articles, times you play a particular music track. You can join the dark side and enter the incognito mode to refresh the counter! This works on only some websites though.

**Caveats**

Private browsing does not secure your computer form everything. Sure, it prevents some date such as cookies to be stored on your computer, but it does not prevent external applications like those form ISPs, your employers, or spyware from spying on your computer.
