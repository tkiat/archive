## Introduction

I first know nginx when I was about to setup my website on DigitalOcean server. I chose Nginx due to availability of tutorial from that cloud provider website. So what it is? It is an open source software that can act as 

- local balancer (layer 7 in OSI model)
- reverse proxy server etc. Cloudfalre uses nginx to serve cdn. Reverse proxy can defense against bot or attacker
- other 3rd party modules 

security control such as rate limiting and access control. Rate limiting is useful against someone who tries to brute force login attempt

## Do You Really Need Nginx?

Actually, you dont need  .. TODO https://www.quora.com/When-using-node-js-do-you-still-need-Nginx-or-Apache

## Setup

I am not going to describe in detail since it will always change. You can search Google yourself for each step :)

1. Installing Nginx. It depends on your operating system. Go to official nginx website for guide.
2. Check firewall if Nginx HTTP traffic is allowed
3. Check your webserver. First check if Nginx is running then enter your server's IP address in your browser. If everything works fine, Nginx landing page should appear.
4. Set up server block. This is optional step but this allows Nginx to host more than one domain. NGinx will serve as reverse proxy server to get request to each of the running applications or websites.
