Bad advice

Good advice
1. Programming is not about languages. What matters is paradigm change like pythons don't teach how to do memory management.
2. Programming is not memorizing.
3. Most are not about math
4. Programming language is simpler than human language that has much more vocabs.
5. Programming is about solving problems, not mere typing.

Code isn't about language. It has some universal concepts. First know problem then write the concept first then convert to code.

Comments are code. Comments explain code to programmers whereas code explains comments to the computer. Try writing steps first then convert it to comments, then insert codes.

Bad implementations can be googled while bad algotithms usually cannot.
