== Definition
=== What does it mean by as a Service?
The suffix -aaS (as a service) is the way the user consumes it. The typical characteristics are

* The service is provided via cloud technology.
* It is a shared service among many tenants.
* No contract. A client can stop the service upon request.
* Self-service

=== DaaS
D in DaaS refers to either Data or Desktop.

* Data-as-a-Service. The example use case is a large organization with many departments. Each department has the data which many be hard to be understood by others. Data-as-a-Service enables the organization to access real-time data streams from other departments via cloud. More generally, data service can come from anywhere in the world.
* Desktop-as-a-Service delivers virtual desktops to any supported device.

=== IaaS
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as the name suggest, provides the infrastructure to you. In addition to PaaS you also have more areas to manage including operating system and middleware. Examples: Virtual Private Server (Digitalocean, Linode, AWS EC2).

=== PaaS
Platform-as-a-Service provides the playground for developers. They can code and make the application out of it but still not able to chnage anything at lower level. As a result, they have less hassle setting up server by their own, only focus on what is truly important. Examples: Heroku.

=== SaaS
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) is a cloud service that user only uses the service without the need to manage anything. Example includes cloud storage solutions e.g. Dropbox, Onedrive. Other examples include Salesforce (CRM platform) and Zoom (teleconferencing application).

=== XaaS
Anything-as-a-Service is a colective term for anything as a service that includes DaaS, PaaS, etc.
