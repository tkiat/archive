# Coursera Course: Sit Less, Get Active

## Forword

I got this Coursera course for free during a coronavirus outbreak in 2020. My sedentary lifestyle inspired me to take this course. After taking this course, I still drink cola and sit all day long. The certificate given is therefore the epitome of a false sense of accomplishment. But it is, in my opinion, still better than climbing a ladder in Clash Royale. Note: this is a very short course (< 4 hours to me)

## Definition
* Active Travel: a active way to move from one place to another e.g. cycling instead of taking the car
* Environment
	* Built Environment: like gym
	* Natural Environment: anything open to the sky feeling e.g. public park

* Physical Acitivity: any movement that uses energy
	* Moderate Intensity: still can hold conversation e.g. brisk walking
	* Vigorous Intensity: strengthen muscle and bone e.g. running

* Physical Inactivity: (< 30 minutes weekly physical activity)
* Sedentariness: (sitting across the day, bad for bone and health)

## Guideline
* 2.5 hours weekly of at least moderate intensity physical activity (5-18 year olds do more than this)
* Fit person can walk, cycle, etc. faster
* Start simple and build up from there
* Look for credible sources
* At home: stand up at times when doing some activities e.g making phone call, etc.
* At work: get off of the bus one station early, cycling to work, take the stairs, move a bit in front of a standing desk, stretch at times, etc.
* At educational environment: academic potential relates to being physically active, transition point is at university when students have less physical activity
* At leisure center: there are activities for al ages there, look for classes if any
* During pregnancy: still be active at least 2.5 hours of moderate activity per week e.g. taking stairs instead of lift, pelvic floor exercises
* Dance: there is no languages/age/ability boundary. Find class on the internet or actually join somewhere. You can choose fast or slow dance
* Make physical acitivity a habit. It takes average of 66 days to form new habit
* Support others to sit less and get more active

## Monitoring Physical Activity
* May use pedometer or phone to count steps
* Use SMART Goals: M (Measureable), S (Specific), A (Agreed), R (Realistic), T (Time-phased)
