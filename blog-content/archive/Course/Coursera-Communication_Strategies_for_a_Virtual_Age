== Review
I got this Coursera course for free during a coronavirus outbreak in 2020. I was interested in virtual communication since I like to code and the coders often like to collaborate online. In the course introduction the instructor believes the only way to learn is by doing. He is not going to teach you rules but rather tools. The course features a peer-graded assignment at the end of the course, which the learner has the opportunity to improve his/her presentation skills by creating both slide and video presentation using the previous tricks and tips that have been taught.

In my opinion, this is one of the best courses I have taken from Coursera. The Instructor not only explains it well but also gives concrete daily-life examples. The resource links given are very useful.

== Week 1
=== The 3 Traps of Communication
* 3 traps: 1. Speaking in Third Person: e.g. using we and they instead of I and you. Specific facebook post can be stronger than general evidence. 2. Using Formal Language. Strategy: start with formal then informal. 3. Too many Details
* Suggestion, start planning with the hook (what info audience should get). Pecha kucha: 20 slides x 20 seconds.

=== Virtual Communication
* Misconception #1: it's always easier to communicate in person (argument: conflicting personalities, group think)
* Misconception #2: in person, it's easier to feel belong to a team (argument: hard to break to tribe)
* Three types of remote teams: 1. Only one guy remote 2. Everybody remote 3. No one remote but still talk virtually. Tips: Virtual reward via recognition with group message

=== Social Dynamics
* Everyone needs some vent so try e.g. give some random tasks to engage employees like doing something funny
* To address sensitive issues e.g. clients do late payment try 4 steps 1. Address: don‘t focus on particular person but rather pattern 2. Admit: admit your own shortcomings so rather focus on common behaviors of us 3. Assess: get their perspectives of why they do that 4. Ask: ask them what to do about it so it‘s their idea oh don‘t forget to come up with planned action

== Week 2
=== Interactive Awesome
* Too much communication implies dysfunctional organization, try to have as necessary at best try to tell purpose for each individual attendee. Try to give attendee less time to talk so they will plan. Give attendees pre-allocated homeworks.
* Quality in Conversation Turn-Taking (QCTT)
* Psychological Safety (PS) - No fear of punishment for mistakes
* In virtual world unlike real world you font know if audience pay attention to it. Strategies 1. Use rhetorical questions 2. Ask people to use interactive option like typing
* When ask question try not to speak only two persons. Try to get interactive reponses from others as well

== Week 3
=== Four Styles of Communications
1. Hostile (disagree openly). A Blunt person who speaks no in front of everyone. They category things into yes, no or A, B, C. Write in bullets and categories. Maybe give them choices e.g. time slots.
2. Indifferent (ya, ok, um). They feel unimportant. So make them feel important, ask them for advices e.g. I need your help, only you can help me with this. Try to crack the door gradually.
3. Uninformed (I will get to that soon). Empathize + ask for point of view e.g. I know it's super busy but there are three criteria ... Here is the quick summary ... What option should I get
4. Supportive (yes person). They want to be liked. Things to include in conversation 1. Small talk (e.g. how about weekend? I mowned lawn...) 2. Everybody and everything (say I ask everybody they tell you are the best person to answer) 3. General then specific (can you do next week, then Tuesday, then Tuesday morning)

=== Three Main Underlying Motivations
This part is taken from book: Power is the Great Motivator
1. Achievement. Traits: constantly working alone, want feedback, want moderate risk. How to influence: give slightly unreasonable goal.
2. Affliation. Traits: want to organize group activities, want to avoid risk. How to influence: appraoch everything as to improve group harmony e.g. tell manager to buy new computers since everyone complains about current ones or tell fellow that we need you to get on board with us because you are important...
3. Power to influence. Traits: want to be in charge of or have a say in everything. How to influence: give them power i.e. put them in charge. Example, hey I want you to do research and base on that we will make decision or hey boss I want to do this can you help me make decision. If there are disagreements in decision tell them to experiment with some ideas and tell which is better.

=== Three Types of Questions
    1. Closed-ended. Break the ice to begin conversation. Then direct conversation. Using this alone is not effective since they can mentally shut down.
    2. Open-ended. More effective in video chat and in person than email. Why? 1. Create relationship 2. Find their motivation/communication style 3. Make them feel important.
    3. Strategic. Question that moves someone to do action. You should nudge towards action. The smaller, the better. Use hypothetical question e.g. if I can do website for that can you accept my proposal? How much score would you give for your room cleanness? 2? Explain why it is not 1 (or why not 3).

=== Positional vs Principled bargaining
Positional bargaining is about arguing for the outcome e.g. money, time, whereas Principle bargaining is the argument about what's underneath (why question). If we disagree in the positional bargaining, we might still agree in the principle bargaining. For example, disagree in a raise so ask hey I know you feel like doing a lot of work. Do you feel like not recognized for it? If agree, then build up from here.

== Week 4
=== How the Brain Listen
5% rule: people will remember 5% of what you said. 5% boils down to 1 thing you said + 1 general impression about you.

=== Speaking to the Brain
* Area 47 (from a book: The Organized Mind by Daniel Levitin) is a part of a brain. Area 47 shuts down when you know what is coming next or things are too complex, making you bored. By contrast, curiosity actives area 47. So use this uncertainty to create interest. Example, does anyone here likes to be touch by a stranger?... Ah I get it it is massage therapy.
* GOS (The Goal Opportunity Statement): one sentence that summarizes the speech. Formula: By doing (action) we achieve (benefit) within (time). This helps open area 47.
* KNOW-Phrase: A slogan of a few words that anchors you to information. It activates area 47. Example, bla bla bla then Why not make doughnut with cookies inside?
* Belly Button rule: whenever you talk, point your belly button to whom you speak to. In virtual world you ask area 47 question and pause. Example, I love shower.

=== Showing the brain
* The lazy rule: instead of putting all answers on slide, make slide beg question. This activates area 47. Example, reduce long bullet point to like P2P Trading, the audience will want to know what is P2P Trading.
* Picture superiority effect. Find a picture that begs a question. Example, here is the strategy next year (12months [][][] 60 stores)
