Humans are usually terrible at making passwords. Phases such as "password", "password123", "firstname" are not secure. A passphrase: a combination of words such as "correct horse battery staple" is considered to be much more secure because of the very high amount of entropy (randomness). Even the phrase "Tr0ub4dor&3" is not as secure as the previous mentioned passphrase.

**Using a Password Manager is Even Better!**

Imagine you use the same password on every website, including banking websites. The security of well-known brands is usually top-notch but what about another random shady website you are logging using the same password? If the password is leaked on that website, a cracker (or unethical hacker) can use the same credential to log in to your bank account.

The best way to cope with this is to set different passwords for all websites. But our average joe's memory does not allow us to do so. That's where a password manager comes in. It stores all passwords for us and is usually integrated into common web browsers like Chrome and Firefox, mobile OS like android and iOS, and desktop OS. Here are some examples of password managers:

- Lastpass
- Bitwarden
- Keepass
- 1Password

We need to remember only one password to use a password manager though. Again I recommend using a passphrase.

**Can we really trust a password manager?**

That is your work to research yourself about each password manager. Or you may simply use an open-source password manager since everyone can verify the (client-side) code. The server-side code (non-verifiable) doesn't matter much if it is encrypted perfectly from the client-side. A password manager like Bitwarden even allows you to host it yourself on your server! All passwords are non-reversible hashed, which means if a cracker somehow manages to get your hashed password he can still not get your true password.
